# Lifespan Treadmill Protocol Analysis

I have worked on analyzing both the serial protocol that goes on the DB9 between treadmill and console.
This is in the `serial/` folder.

There is also a Bluetooth low energy protocol that is used by the mobile app to pull session information
off of the "Omni Console". See the `ble/` folder for my captures and notes there.
